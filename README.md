# Vulnscan

CyberIQ Vulnscan uses Nmap and Vulners to scan an external target or internal network for vulnerabilities. It makes the process a little simpler by prompting you for the values that Nmap uses in its comman line arguments.

It is a combination of Python and Bash scripts that automatically determine your IP address, CIDR, broadcast address, gateway, and network address for internal scans.

When finished, Vulnscan will display the output of the Nmap/Vulners scan in a web browser.
